# Recurrent Neural Network
Recurrent neural networks or RNNs (Rumelhart et al., 1986a) are a family of neural networks for processing sequential data. Most recurrent networks can also process sequences of variable length.

A recurrent neural network shares the same weights across several time steps.

Some examples of important design patterns for recurrent neural networks include the following:
Recurrent networks that produce an output at each time step and have recurrent connections between hidden units, illustrated in left figure.

Recurrent networks that produce an output at each time step and have recurrent connections only from the output at one time step to the hidden units at the next time step, illustrated in medium figure.

Recurrent networks with recurrent connections between hidden units, that read an entire sequence and then produce a single output, illustrated in right figure.
