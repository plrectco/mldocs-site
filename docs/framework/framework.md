# Machine Learning Library and Framework：

** What is a Machine Learning Framework and why do we need it? **

	Machine learning engineers are part of the engineering team who build the product and the algorithms, making sure that it works reliably, quickly, and at-scale. However, to implement a machine learning algorithm, we usually need to deal with:

		+Large scale size of data
		+Complex mathematical computation

	Machine Learning Frameworks and relative libraries help us deal with such issues and make the implementation much easier.

** Some Popular Machine Learning Framework: **

	+Caffe
		Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and by community contributors. Yangqing Jia created the project during his PhD at UC Berkeley. Caffe is released under the BSD 2-Clause license.  Models and optimization are defined by configuration without hard-coding & user can switch between CPU and GPU. Speed makes Caffe perfect for research experiments and industry deployment. Caffe can process over 60M images per day with a single NVIDIA K40 GPU.

	+Torch
		Torch is a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine learning algorithms that puts GPUs first. It is easy to use and efficient, thanks to an easy and fast scripting language, LuaJIT, and an underlying C/CUDA implementation. The goal of Torch is to have maximum flexibility and speed in building your scientific algorithms while making the process extremely simple. Torch comes with a large ecosystem of community-driven packages in machine learning, computer vision, signal processing, parallel processing, image, video, audio and networking among others, and builds on top of the Lua community.

	+Tensorflow
		TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. TensorFlow implements what are called data flow graphs, where batches of data (“tensors”) can be processed by a series of algorithms described by a graph. The movements of the data through the system are called “flows” — hence, the name. Graphs can be assembled with C++ or Python and can be processed on CPUs or GPUs.
